                Hello, My name's Kim ji-yun! Welcome to my homepage.<br>
                I wandered for a long time.<br>
                The first was when I was a high school student, and the second was when I was a college student.<br>
                The third time was when I was a member of society.<br>
                I don't think that time is wrong.<br>
                I don't think I can be a great developer.<br>
                But I want to be a developer who can do my part.<br>
                There are definitely times when I feel ashamed or depressed, but I believe there will be a better tomorrow. <br>
                I hope to smile a lot when I look back on today. <br>
                <br><br>
                In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! <br>
                To a better tomorrow!<br>
